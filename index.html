        <p>
            Puspa Mitta Sungha was a soul of quiet strength and luminous heart,
            known for uplifting those around her with wisdom, kindness, and
            unwavering courage. Born from humble roots, she blossomed into a
            woman whose compassion touched many lives.

            She believed that every being carries a spark of beauty and every
            moment holds meaning. Her journey was one of seeking truth,
            cherishing simplicity, and walking gently with others through both
            joy and hardship. Puspa’s presence was like a warm light in the
            darkness—steady, assuring, and true.
